The Brief description for the M&A Report about the Tesco Plc. acquisition of the wholesaler Booker Group

ASSESSMENT DETAILS
Tesco acquires Booker

Tesco has struck a deal to buy wholesaler Booker Group for £3.7bn, further extending 
the reach of the UK’s biggest supermarket chain in the country’s food industry. The 
deal, which has sparked the resignation of a senior director at the supermarket, comes 
after a year of talks and is likely to raise questions about its impact on Britain’s highly 
concentrated grocery sector, where Tesco enjoys a 28 per cent market share. In 
Booker, Tesco is snapping up the supplier to hundreds of convenience stores that 
compete with Tesco’s own small format shops as well as restaurant chains, including 
Wagamama and Byron Burger.
